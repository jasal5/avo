                    <h3>Transport</h3>
                    <p>Thankfully, Dubai and Abu Dhabi are cities where you do not necessarily need a car.  
                        The tram systme in Dubai is state of the art andn can get you up and down the city within an hour.  
                        There are multiple options to get to Abu Dhabi from Dubai and vice versa, which is only 170km away.  
                        The cheapest opition is a bus which takes approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes and costs about 7£.  
                        A taxi would only cut down the trip by 30 minutes and cost about 75£  </p>

                    <h3>Sights</h3>
                    <p>Burj Khalifa, 
                        Highly recommend visiting both regions when there is a big event going on for added fun such as 
                        UFC Fights, NASCAR, Dubai Rugby 7s, concerts, car shows, exhibitions, etc.  In Abu Dhabi the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque 
                        is a must. The largest mosque in the country and place of daily worship. You can really apprecaite the astonishing architecture
                        Don't forget to take a stroll on Corinche Road which displays a gorgeous waterfront backdrop for pictures! You can 
                        find cycle and nwalking pahtways, resturants, cafes, andn Corinche beach, 8km to kill plenty of time.
                        Ferrari World is pretty cool and kid friendly. And if you're an art lover, the Louvre Abu Dhabi is a must.  
                        It is also the largest art museum in the Arabian peninsula!</p>


                    <h3>Culture</h3>
                    <p>The majority of countries in the Middle East are Muslim and have strict rules that men andn women have to follow.  
                        Make sure to pack conservatively to show respect to local cultures and traditions.  
                        From my experiece, wearing a tank top and shorts is OK as longn as it's modest. 
                        Don't forget to bring a shawl or cover up just in case you enter a place where you need to cover up. Abu Dhabi is more conservative than Dubai so keep this in mind when traveling to this location. </p>


                    <h3>Food</h3>
        
                    <p>One word, DELICIOUS! Emirati cuisine is well.. prepare yourself for an experience like you've never had before. 
                        However, of course Dubai is an international hub, so you can absolutley find cuisines inspired from the rest of
                        the Middle East and Asia.  Many foods include spice, so hopefully you're up for it.  And don't forget to order a fresh hummus and tabouleh.  
                        I can guarantee it's not like anything you've ever tasted before.
